# Blinkit Grocery Delivery DBMS Project

## Project Overview
This project designs a DBMS-based relational database for Blinkit’s instant grocery delivery platform. It focuses on efficiently managing customers, products, warehouses, delivery partners, orders, inventory, payments, and deliveries while ensuring data integrity, scalability, and real-time order processing.

## System Design
The database is designed using core **DBMS principles**, including:
- Entity Relationship (ER) Modeling  
- Normalization (to reduce redundancy)
- Primary & Foreign Key Constraints
- Relational Integrity

The ER diagram visually represents relationships between entities such as customers, orders, products, warehouses, and delivery partners.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open **MySQL Workbench**
2. Import the ER diagram file (`.mwb`) to view the database design
3. Open the SQL file
4. Execute the script to create tables and relationships
5. Verify data integrity using sample queries

- Efficient order and inventory management
- Scalable schema suitable for real-time grocery delivery
- Proper use of constraints for data consistency

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of DBMS concepts
- Hands-on experience with ER modeling
- Understanding real-world e-commerce database design
- Improved SQL and schema design skills

---

## Use Case
This project is ideal for:
- DBMS academic submissions
- Learning database design
- Demonstrating real-world system modeling
- Resume and GitHub portfolio projects

---

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the design and implementation of a robust relational database for an instant grocery delivery system like Blinkit. By applying ER modeling, normalization, and relational constraints, the database ensures accuracy, scalability, and efficient data handling, making it suitable for real-world, high-volume order management systems.
