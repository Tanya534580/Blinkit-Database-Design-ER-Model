# Blinkit Grocery Delivery DBMS Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project designs a DBMS-based relational database for Blinkit’s instant grocery delivery platform. It focuses on efficiently managing customers, products, warehouses, delivery partners, orders, inventory, payments, and deliveries while ensuring data integrity, scalability, and real-time order processing.

---

## 🧩 System Design
The database is designed using core **DBMS principles**, including:
- Entity Relationship (ER) Modeling  
- Normalization (to reduce redundancy)
- Primary & Foreign Key Constraints
- Relational Integrity

The ER diagram visually represents relationships between entities such as customers, orders, products, warehouses, and delivery partners.
